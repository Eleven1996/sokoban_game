/** WRITE YOUR TIPS IN THIS FILE **/
1. DO NOT GET FEVER
2. spend decent time on reading the provided code and instructions
3. first write the two anytime search function,because this is (almost) irrelevant to the game
4. for writing alt-heru, list some "special" cases in games, better in graph form,then trying to give best considerations
in the solution
5. Use google when stuck (but do not copy),there are similar solutions online, some of them maybe wrong or not good enough,
understand the logic(usually just cases you didnt realize), write down in words,then implement yourself.
6. try to test single function before use it (the assignment does not require it just run it in console to make sure it is
right)
